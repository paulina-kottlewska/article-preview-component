- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

### Design
I was provided with a design for this project from Frontend Mentor. The design was clear and user-friendly. I had to recreate this design and bring it to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Development 
Development was done with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML created the structure for the sharing card, while CSS provided styling. I used JavaScript to add the functionality to the share button, allowing the user to toggle between viewing the profile and sharing options.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped to strengthen my skills in creating responsive designs and working with JavaScript to add interactivity to a page. I gained a deeper understanding of event listeners and manipulating the DOM.
